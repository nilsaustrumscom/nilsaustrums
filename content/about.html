            <p>Since I was a child a had a huge interest in fine arts, therefore naturally I chose to study sculpturing in college. Since then I have a mastered 3D arts, and right now I am freelancing in Latvia, working on various interior/architecture projects.
            </p>
            <p>I love games, movies, cosmos and traveling and would be great to work on a project which involves all or some of those things.</p>
            <p>Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more about me or my works!</p>
